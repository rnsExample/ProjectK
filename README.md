# ProjectK

This file contains information for the written challenge.  It contains my python code untitled2.py which renders some basic code, and also the produced plots.
The plots produced include:
1. Geographic location of users and user type (interactive):  mapofusers.html . If the file does not render when you click, you can preview its capabilities by going to : https://htmlpreview.github.io/? and pasting the URL of my file in the menu.
2. Time of video vs number of shares. (The file initially included all videos, then splits for AR videos, and non AR videos but they were equally uninteresting, so only DurationNumberShares.png is here)
    a. This included correlations in the file, but they are largely uninteresting
4. Time of year video plays. ![WatchedDayOfYear](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104521479/166091262-710a2db9-d6e0-4e94-a3c2-e24365ee3d94.png)

5. Time of week video plays
