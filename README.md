# ProjectK

This file contains information for the written challenge.  It contains my python code untitled2.py which renders some basic code, and also the produced plots.
The plots produced include:
1. Geographic location of users and user type
2. Time of video vs number of shares (all videos, AR videos, and non AR videos)
    a. This included correlations in the file, but they are largely uninteresting
4. Time of year video plays.
5. Time of week video plays
